# Tech Test Brief - this is the original instructions for the task

## Overview

We are seeking a capable developer to build a front-end application using either React or Next.js, combined with TypeScript. Your choice of framework should be based on your preference and expertise. The application should closely align with the designs found in this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/hGBI3zpyHia5yrWsgeMP3K/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev). It is essential that the application utilises Styled Components for styling.

## Technical Requirements

### General

- The application must be developed using TypeScript.
- Utilise Styled Components for styling the components in accordance with the Figma designs.
- We often find the need to make slight alterations to the designs - please use your best judgement to make the necessary adjustments, particularly adding a column for usernames.
- Implement a search functionality that allows for searching payouts based on various criteria, including username. Please see the API Integration section for more details, and as above tweak the designs as you see fit.

### API Integration

You will be integrating with an existing API. Here are the details of the endpoints you will need to interact with:

1. **Payouts Endpoint**

   **Endpoint:** `https://theseus-staging.lithium.ventures/api/v1/analytics/tech-test/payouts`

   **Method:** GET

   - `status`: A string indicating the status of the payout (Pending or Completed).
   - `value`: A string representing the value of the payout.
   - `username`: A string representing the username associated with the payout.

2. **Search Endpoint**

   **Endpoint:** `https://theseus-staging.lithium.ventures/api/v1/analytics/tech-test/search?query=SEARCH_TERM`

   **Method:** GET

   **Description:** This endpoint allows for searching payouts by username. Implement a functionality that facilitates user search with a keen focus on optimizing the user experience whilst considering performance.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Adherence to the design as specified in the Figma file.
- Proper usage of TypeScript and Styled Components.
- Attention to detail in implementing various functionalities.
- Optimizations implemented to enhance the user experience.
